My first week of CT 20 was honestly pretty good. I was a bit nervous before taking this class because I didn't really know what to expect. 
But after learning more about the course and the things we will work on, I feel more comfortable now. 
I have very little experience with coding, so I'm excited to get back into it.
I have used GitHub before, but honestly I forgot how to use it for the most part, so it should be interesting trying to learn it again.
I've never used P5js editor before, but after messing around with it in class on Thursday, I'm excited to learn how to use it.
I want to make cool stuff/designs using the P5js editor, and I'm also looking forward to learning new functions and references.
The idea of creative coding is really cool, because it's a bit different than traditional coding. I feel like creative coding is going to be more fun!
Overall, I am excited to learn a new language and explore new tools.
